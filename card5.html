              <p>Inspired by old sea traveler maps and looking for ways to play on connectivity, Alexandra Kogia and I created a game in Touchdesigner where one wins based on achieved interaction. As the commanding captain, you control all of the movements of the ship with your phone. Get the vessel from Greece to Mexico and vice-versa and win interaction points on every successful trip, but be careful, rocks and sea monsters will block your path! Crash into obstacles or the mainland more than  three times and you lose the game. The point of the game is to grow the network and increase connectivity! Just as the great explorers did many years ago.
              </p>

                <p>The ship responds to the accelerometer of oneÂ´s phone (only considers x and z coordinates). As your phone moves, so
                will the ship.</p>
                <p>Touch OSC layout displaying on your phone screen allows you to increase the difficulty of the game by adding obstacles, zoom in and zoom out the camera, and change the display of water particles within the game.
