                <p>The diploma project confronts school as a concept, an activity, a place and a community. It deals with the relationship of the users with each other and with the site, aiming to meet the needs of the students, to get out of the classroom, spread all over the school’s free spaces and take advantage of every opportunity given; to learn outside the spatial, spiritual, and social boundaries that a typical school environment usually entails.
                  The research revolves around the spheres of education and technology. As far as education is concerned the focus is given on the learning importance of space, and the various trends and applications in education, such as smart learning environments, the concept of Edutainment, or even older ones, such as Gardner theory of Multiple Intelligence. From the technology point of view, the research studies the human-machine and human-computer interaction. The outcomes of this research are implemented on this diploma project.

                  The two dipoles of formal and informal, intentional and unexpected learning, create a combinatorial diagram of needs of space that imply both the new building program and the structure of the school complex, which encourages the morning school operation and the afternoon activities operation.
                  The proposal suggests a new system of curved steel structures that intervenes in the old and embraces the existing conventional buildings. A library and an auditorium are located at the front facade, reinforcing the school’s role as a public place and defining the central entrance to the complex.
                  The new system integrates with an elevated path that creates new qualities of educational space as well as relaxation and entertainment space.                </p>

                <p>Quotidian Lift suggests an immersive synthetic sound and light ecology; the physical matches with the immaterial and the reality with the abstract towards creating new connections to spaces. Light and sound may rearrange spaces’ spatial layout, develop novel, uncanny and strange adventures.
